# Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Dataset)


Here you will find a simple implementation of a ML model trained to perform **sentiment analysis**, using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library and the [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

The application was developed using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) and [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).
